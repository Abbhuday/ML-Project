# ML-Project

I have made the following ML project for my college assignment. In this machine learning project, the overall topic that will be resolved is in the health sector regarding stroke, where it will try to predict the possibility of a stroke in a person with certain conditions based on several factors including: age, certain diseases (hypertension, heart disease) who are at high risk of developing stroke. strokes, cigarettes, etc.

Machine learning modeling to predict stroke in patients uses the K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier algorithm. This algorithm works based on existing features and similarities between these features to classify targets.

**baseline_model = KNeighborsClassifier()
**
At the beginning of making the model, the K-NearestNeighborsClassifier model is used with default parameters and when the results are shown the classification achieves an accuracy of 97.5% which has reached the target of model accuracy.
